## Terms of Service
### 1. Principles

- "owo.rs" is a free service provided by "iriie". All of the services offered by owo.rs fall under these terms.
- owo.rs's subdomains service is meant to be used with other hosting services (e.g. GitHub Pages, Surge, Runkod, Vercel, etc.). The rights of what hosting service the user uses will remain unaffected by these terms.
- Communication from the user to iriie will take place on GitHub through their issues, pull requests, and comments. iriie, however, may contact the user on their specified email or social media.
- By submitting a pull request in the uwuers/owo.rs GitHub repo, the user accepts these terms and conditions on all services provided under the "owo.rs" name.

### 2. Availability

- owo.rs will make a "best effort" to ensure the availability of the subdomain service.
- The user acquires no ownership or any other rights to any part of "owo.rs"
- If the user violates the terms, iriie may exclude the user from the service without notice. iriie may terminate or modify the service at any time, with no notice.

### 3. Termination

- Both sides can terminate at any time with any reason.
- The user can terminate by making a pull request in the uwuers/owo.rs repository with the wish of removing their subdomain from the list of active subdomains.

### 4. Duties of the user

- The user is fully responsible of all content they choose to publish on their subdomain, and they are responsible for extricating iriie from all third party claims.
- The user has to follow the acceptable use policy.
- A violation will result in deletion of the user's subdomain.
- The user is required to put contact information (their e-mail address, their full/preferred name, and/or social network addresses) on their subdomain.

### 5. Liability

- iriie provides no responsibility or is liable for anything that may occur. Using the owo.rs service takes place at the user's own risk.
- The user waives the right to sue and will hold iriie and owo.rs harmless.
- The user is liable for payment to iriie for services rendered that had agreements for payment attached to them.
- The user is liable for any use performed by their GitHub account.
- The user is liable for anything they put on their subdomain.
- Legal representatives are liable for minors.

### 6. Release and Indemnification
- If the user has a dispute with one or more users, the user agrees to release iriie from any and all claims, demands, and damages of all kinds in any way connected with said disputes.
- The user agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold iriie harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneysâ€™ fees, arising out of the user's use of this service, including but not limited to the user's violation of these Terms, given that iriie gives the user sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that the user may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases iriie of all liability), at the user's expense.

### 7. Subdomain Names
- Users can create names of subdomains in accordance to the acceptable use policy.
- It is the user's responsibility to make sure their subdomain name does not violate any rights and is not misleading.
- A violation may result in deletion of the user's subdomain.

### 8. Spam
- The user mass-registering domain names is not allowed.
- References to subdomains and domains registered at owo.rs in unsolicited email or similar (spam) is not allowed.

### 9. Responsbility
- owo.rs and iriie are not responsible for names or content of subdomains, nor are they responsible for any websites linked.

### 10. Changes to the Terms
- iriie reserves the right to make changes to the Terms of Service. iriie will make a "best-effort" to notice the user of the changes.

### 11. Severability Clause
- If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforcable, that portion will be construed to reflect iriie's original intent. The remaining portions will still be in effect.
- Any failure on the part of iriie to enforce anything in the Terms will not be considered a waiver of iriie's right to enforce this provision. 
- iriie's rights will survive any termination of this agreement.
